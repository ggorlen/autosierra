# autosierra
Tool for personal use to automate batch processing in the Innovative Sierra software program. 

Function: Reads a plain text file containing barcodes of items to be processed in Sierra, opens an instance of Sierra or switches to a running Sierra process, navigates through basic Sierra menus, and batch processes a macro stored in Sierra's CTRL+F12 keystroke for each barcode.

Issues: Due to the nature of the program's simulation of human keystrokes, the program cannot detect input errors or any feedback from Sierra.

Todos: Add abort feature.
